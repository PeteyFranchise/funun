### 🚧 v1.2 — Wave 4: The Green Room (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Turn Funūn's thin social layer into a full professional network for the music industry — rich member profiles, discovery, connections, notifications, and real-time presence — recreated pixel-faithfully from the locked hi-fi design handoff.

- [x] **Phase 8: Identity & Schema Foundation** - Extend the member-identity table and stand up the connection/block/notification/presence schema with column-privilege and block-enforcement guarantees baked in (completed 2026-07-05)
- [x] **Phase 9: Rich Member Profile** - Ship the hi-fi hero profile (banner, avatar, role badges, "Open to" chips, stats, releases grid, Featured spotlight) with owner-vs-public view switching and image upload (completed 2026-07-12)
- [ ] **Phase 10: Connections & Notifications** - Follow + Connect request/accept relationships and a notifications bell with unread badge and mark-all-read panel
- [ ] **Phase 11: Presence & Messaging** - Realtime presence dots + "Active now", floating DM widget with unread badge, cold message-request flow with rate limiting, and direct messaging once connected
- [ ] **Phase 12: Discovery & People Search** - Global people search with filters and a Discover tab organized by role and genre, enforced server-side with block/visibility exclusion
- [ ] **Phase 13: Network Tab & Trust & Safety** - Network tab (follows/connections/pending), hard bidirectional block, member/message reporting, admin verified-badge grant, and profile visibility controls

### 🚧 Sound Vault — Playback Room Refinement (In Progress)

**Not part of The Green Room milestone theme.** Surfaced during Phase 9 discussion: the private artist-facing Playback room (`playback.html` design — tracklist editing, WAV/stems upload, credits & splits editing, metadata editing) is existing Wave 1 Sound Vault functionality (`app/(artist)/vault/[projectId]/play/page.tsx`, `components/vault/PlaybackView.tsx`) that needs its own refinement pass, separate from Phase 9's public-player split work.

- [ ] **Phase 14: Playback Room Refinement** - Polish the private Playback room and ship "Export pack" (bundling metadata/stems/master/MP3 for a music supervisor) — scope TBD pending discussion (execution complete 2026-07-06; awaiting UAT — see 14-UAT.md)

### ✅ Account Capability Model (Complete)

**Cross-cutting identity change — not part of The Green Room feature set.** Surfaced during a discussion about the artist/industry account split: today `member_type` is a single exclusive value set at account creation, so one login can never hold both artist and industry capabilities. Replaced with a `capability_grants` table (D-01/D-02) and a unified, capability-aware nav (D-05/D-08); the artist→instant / industry→admin-approved asymmetric gate (D-02) plus the in-app approval queue (D-03) closed the loop.

- [x] **Phase 15: Account Capability Model** - Replace the single `member_type` value with multiple capability grants on one account (4/4 plans executed 2026-07-12)

## Phase Details

### Phase 8: Identity & Schema Foundation

**Goal**: The database is ready to back a professional network — one unified member-identity model with the connection, block, notification, and presence-read tables in place, and private fields locked down before any UI can expose them.
**Depends on**: Phase 7 (previous milestone)
**Requirements**: (foundation — no user-facing requirement lands here; every requirement in Phases 9–13 depends on this schema)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `artist_profiles` carries the extended identity columns (member_type, location, pronouns, banner_url, bio, open_to, featured_project_id, search_vector) with a GIN trigram index for search
  2. New `connections` (mutual request/accept) and `blocks` (bidirectional) tables exist with RLS enabled, and a `no_block()` SECURITY DEFINER helper gates inserts on socially-exposed tables
  3. The `notifications` table is extended with actor-snapshot columns and added to the realtime publication; a `dm_thread_reads` table exists for DM unread counts
  4. A column-level REVOKE/GRANT migration ships in the same migration that adds any private column, so no authenticated user can read private fields via direct PostgREST
  5. Industry-member identity is created without a `handle_new_user()` phantom-row race (role set at `admin.createUser()` time, early-return branch added)

**Design references**: none in the design bundle — schema-only phase, no user-facing requirement. The one small UI surface (admin industry-member invite page) is ad hoc, not a hi-fi mockup from `docs/design/wave-4-social-layer/`.

**Plans**: 6/6 plans complete

- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md
- [x] 08-02-PLAN.md
- [x] 08-03-PLAN.md
- [x] 08-04-PLAN.md
- [x] 08-05-PLAN.md
- [x] 08-06-PLAN.md

### Phase 9: Rich Member Profile

**Goal**: A member's `/u/[handle]` profile renders the locked hi-fi hero screen and behaves differently for the owner versus a visitor — proving the unified-identity model end-to-end in the browser.
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: PROFILE-01, PROFILE-02, PROFILE-03, PROFILE-04, PROFILE-05, PROFILE-06, PROFILE-07, PROFILE-08, PROFILE-09
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. User sees a rich profile header — banner, avatar with presence dot, name, pronouns, verified badge, and multi-role badges with the lead role highlighted, plus a standard-or-custom title
  2. User sees location, tenure ("On Funūn since [year]"), "Open to" status chips, a stats sidebar (followers, monthly listeners, placements, avg. readiness), and a releases grid with readiness rings on any profile
  3. User can pin one release as a "Featured" spotlight on their profile
  4. Profile owner sees Edit profile / Share / View analytics actions and can upload/edit their banner and avatar; a visitor sees Follow / Message / more-options instead

**Plans**: 6/6 plans complete

Plans:

- [x] 09-01a-PLAN.md — Wave 0 foundation (autonomous): four RED Jest scaffolds + `"test": "jest"` script + additive `TrackLyrics.synced` (D-13) + `OPEN_TO_VALUES` export
- [x] 09-01b-PLAN.md — DB/API layer: `lib/profile/validate.ts` validators (GREEN) + PATCH allowlist/featured pre-check + placements stat + migration 043 (`allow_resharing`) + [BLOCKING] schema push
- [x] 09-02-PLAN.md — Avatar/banner upload route + `AvatarBannerUpload` component (vault-assets bucket, PROFILE-09)
- [x] 09-03-PLAN.md — Public `PublicPlaybackView` (+ own `PublicTrackView` type) + `LyricsPanel` + `/r/[projectId]` render swap (D-01..D-14)
- [x] 09-04-PLAN.md — Settings roles/open-to/resharing editors + `ShareButton` + `ProfileMoreMenu` + `FeaturedPicker` (PROFILE-02/04/05/08)
- [x] 09-05-PLAN.md — ProfileView + `/u/[handle]` integration: presence dot, placements row, mount share/upload/picker/menu, server-resolved absolute `profileUrl` (PROFILE-01/03/06/08/09)

**Wave 1**: 09-01a (Wave 0 tests + additive types — autonomous)
**Wave 2** *(blocked on 09-01a)*: 09-01b (validators GREEN + allowlist + placements + migration 043 + [BLOCKING] push)
**Wave 3** *(blocked on 09-01b)*: 09-02 ‖ 09-03 ‖ 09-04 (parallel — zero file overlap)
**Wave 4** *(blocked on 09-01b, 09-02, 09-04)*: 09-05 (ProfileView + page integration)

**UI hint**: yes
**Design references**: `docs/design/wave-4-social-layer/user-profile.html` (primary — header, roles, stats, releases grid, Featured spotlight, owner-vs-visitor actions), `artist-profile.html` (the new public "now playing" player, D-01), `playback.html` (contrast only — stays the private working room, out of this phase's scope). Full detail already gathered in `09-CONTEXT.md`.

### Phase 10: Connections & Notifications

**Goal**: Members can build an explicit graph — follow one-way or send a mutual Connect request — and get told when something happens to them, via a bell with an accurate unread count.
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Requirements**: CONNECT-01, CONNECT-02, NOTIF-01, NOTIF-02, NOTIF-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. User can follow another member with no approval, and can send a Connect request that the recipient can accept or decline to establish a mutual connection
  2. User receives a notification for each of: new follower, connection request, connection accepted, message request, new DM, release comment, endorsement received, and wall post received
  3. User sees an unread-count badge on the notifications bell that is separate from the messages-icon badge
  4. User can open a notification panel, see the list, and mark all as read

**Plans**: 4/6 plans executed

Plans:

- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md — Foundation (Wave 0/1): 3 RED Jest scaffolds + notification type catalog & per-type builders + connect payload/transition builders + `createNotification()`/`Notification` actor-snapshot extension
- [x] 10-02-PLAN.md — Migration 044 (`connections.note` + `no_block()` gap close + SECURITY DEFINER auto-follow-seed trigger) + [BLOCKING] schema push
- [x] 10-03-PLAN.md — API routes: `app/api/connections/route.ts` (request/accept/decline/withdraw) + `app/api/notifications/route.ts` (list+unread COUNT, mark-all-read)
- [x] 10-04-PLAN.md — Notification trigger wiring into 4 existing routes (follows→new_follower, wall→wall_post, endorsements→endorsement, release-comments→release_comment)
- [ ] 10-05-PLAN.md — NotificationBell (global Realtime+poll badge) + NotificationPanel (dropdown, mark-all-read, inline accept/decline, cursor pagination) + net-new authenticated header row
- [ ] 10-06-PLAN.md — ConnectButton (3-state + note composer + inline accept/decline) + ProfileView mount + `#wall`/`#endorsements` anchors + page connect-state derivation

**Wave 1**: 10-01 (autonomous — pure builders + type extensions + Wave-0 tests)
**Wave 2** *(blocked on 10-01)*: 10-02 (migration 044 + [BLOCKING] schema push — not autonomous)
**Wave 3** *(blocked on 10-01, 10-02)*: 10-03 ‖ 10-04 (parallel — zero file overlap: new API routes vs. modified existing routes)
**Wave 4** *(blocked on 10-03)*: 10-05 ‖ 10-06 (parallel — zero file overlap: nav/layout surfaces vs. profile surfaces; both end in a human-verify checkpoint)

**UI hint**: yes
**Design references**: `docs/design/wave-4-social-layer/user-profile.html` — only partial precedent exists: the Follow/Message profile actions (`.pf-actions`) and the topbar notification bell with unread dot (`.pf-iconbtn .dotn`, top-right). **Gap**: no notification panel/dropdown (the actual list shown when the bell is clicked, with mark-all-read) exists anywhere in the design bundle — net-new screen design captured in `10-UI-SPEC.md` (header row, bell+badge+panel, ConnectButton+note composer).

### Phase 11: Presence & Messaging

**Goal**: The network feels alive — members see who is online, message strangers safely through a rate-limited request flow, and message connections directly, all from a floating DM widget that shows unread counts and live "Active now" status.
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Requirements**: PRESENCE-01, PRESENCE-02, PRESENCE-03, CONNECT-03, CONNECT-04, CONNECT-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. User sees an online presence dot on another member's avatar when they are actively on the platform, and "Active now" / "Active X ago" in the DM widget header
  2. The floating DM widget shows an unread message-count badge
  3. User can send a message request to a non-connection; the recipient can accept (opens a DM thread), decline, or block
  4. User is rate-limited on outbound cold message requests (e.g. 10/week), and can message a mutual connection directly with no request step

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes
**Design references**: `docs/design/wave-4-social-layer/user-profile.html` — strong existing precedent, fully designed already: the floating DM widget (`.pf-dm` — header with avatar + "Active now" presence status, message bubbles for both sides, date divider, composer + send button) and the profile avatar's online-presence dot (`.pf-avatar .live`, green dot + "Online" label). **Gap**: no message-request (cold-outreach accept/decline/block) screen or rate-limit UI exists in the bundle — net-new design needed for that specific flow; the DM widget itself is ready to recreate directly.

### Phase 12: Discovery & People Search

**Goal**: Members can find each other — a global search bar and a Discover tab surface artists and industry pros by name, role, genre, and availability, enforced server-side so private and blocked profiles never leak.
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: DISCOVER-01, DISCOVER-02, DISCOVER-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. User can search for members by name, role, or keyword via a global search bar
  2. User can filter search/discovery results by role, "Open to" status, location, and genre
  3. User can browse a Discover tab organized by role category and genre
  4. Search and discovery run server-side only and exclude blocked members and non-public profiles from results

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes
**Design references**: `docs/design/wave-4-social-layer/user-profile.html` — only a static topbar search input (`.pf-search`, placeholder "Search artists, producers, supervisors…") exists as precedent; it is not wired to any results UI. **Gap**: no search-results layout, filter panel, or Discover-tab screen exists anywhere in the design bundle. `docs/design/wave-4-social-layer/antenna.html`'s filter-panel *pattern* (checkboxes with counts, a "minimum match" slider, tag chips) is a plausible structural reference to adapt, though it was designed for opportunity matching, not people search — this phase needs its own net-new screen design during `/gsd-ui-phase`.

### Phase 13: Network Tab & Trust & Safety

**Goal**: The network closes the loop and is safe to open — members manage their relationships in a Network tab and are protected by hard blocks, reporting, admin verification, and visibility controls before wider outreach goes live.
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Requirements**: DISCOVER-04, SAFETY-01, SAFETY-02, SAFETY-03, SAFETY-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. User can browse a Network tab showing people they follow, are connected with, or have pending requests with
  2. User can block another member, and a blocked member cannot view the blocker's profile, message them, or see them in search/discovery results (enforced in RLS, not just the UI)
  3. User can report a member profile or a specific message for admin review, and an admin can grant a verified badge to a member profile
  4. User can set profile visibility (public / connections-only) and can hide their "Open to" status from public view

**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes
**Design references**: none. No file in the design bundle (`docs/design/wave-4-social-layer/`) shows a Network tab, block/report flow, admin verified-badge grant UI, or visibility-control settings — this phase has **zero existing visual precedent** and needs full net-new UI design during its `/gsd-ui-phase` run.

### Phase 14: Playback Room Refinement

**Goal**: The private Playback room (`playback.html`'s design) is polished for the artist's own working use, and a music supervisor or other industry recipient can be handed a complete export (stems, master, MP3, credits, metadata) without needing app access — distinct from Phase 9's public-only "now playing" share player, which stays deliberately stripped of this detail.
**Depends on**: None (existing Wave 1 Sound Vault feature — independent of the Phase 8–13 Green Room chain)
**Requirements**: TBD — pending `/gsd-discuss-phase 14`
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Clicking a Sound Vault project card lands on the playback room; the management page is reachable from it (D-01)
  2. Real stems (250MB ZIP) + instrumental support: Master/Instrumental toggle swaps the audio source, "Download stems" is a separate button, both upload direct-to-storage (D-03..D-08)
  3. A readiness-score widget appears in the topbar and inline, linking to the management page (D-02)
  4. Export Pack bundles every available artifact (master, MP3, stems, instrumental) + credits/splits PDF + metadata PDF, delivered as an immediate download or a 7-day expiring shareable link (D-10..D-12)

**Plans**: 6/6 plans complete
**Wave 1**

- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md — Storage config (250MB + ZIP MIME) + schema readers + packages (archiver/@react-pdf/renderer/tus-js-client)
- [x] 14-02-PLAN.md — D-01 navigation: project card → playback room; management page → playback room link

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 14-03-PLAN.md — Stems + instrumental JSON-only metadata routes (direct-to-storage, no byte proxy)
- [x] 14-04-PLAN.md — Export Pack manifest builder + credits/metadata PDF templates

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2 completion)*

- [x] 14-05-PLAN.md — Playback room rework: Master/Instrumental toggle, uploads, Download-stems, readiness widgets, signed-URL playback fix

**Wave 4** *(blocked on Wave 3 completion)*

- [x] 14-06-PLAN.md — Export Pack route (assemble→upload→signed URL, Hobby-safe) + delivery-choice panel

**UI hint**: yes
**Design references**: `docs/design/wave-4-social-layer/playback.html` (primary target), `sound-vault.html` (D-01 project-card link target), `release-readiness.html` (D-02 widget link target — this phase adds a link to it, does not rebuild it), `artist-profile.html` (contrast only — Phase 9's public player, NOT this phase's scope). Full detail already gathered in `14-CONTEXT.md` / `14-RESEARCH.md`.

### Phase 15: Account Capability Model

**Goal:** A member can hold both artist and industry capabilities on a single account — `member_type` becomes a set of granted capabilities rather than one exclusive value, so a songwriter who is also an industry contact doesn't need a second signup to use both Sound Vault and Antenna.
**Requirements**: TBD (no REQUIREMENTS.md IDs yet — this predates that scoping; decisions D-01..D-14 in 15-CONTEXT.md are the acceptance source)
**Depends on:** Phase 13 (sequencing only — not a technical blocker; scheduled after Green Room ships and beta testing begins, per explicit user decision)
**Plans:** 6/6 plans complete

**Wave 1**

- [x] 15-01-PLAN.md — capability_grants schema (migration 042) + lib/capabilities grant/check helpers + Wave 0 tests + [BLOCKING] schema push (D-01/D-02/D-10/D-12/D-14 foundation)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1)*

- [x] 15-02-PLAN.md — capabilities request + admin approve API routes; D-14 server-side hasCapability() enforcement on opportunity posting

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2)*

- [x] 15-03-PLAN.md — unified capability-aware ArtistNav (D-05/D-08), (industry) layout retirement + route relocation (D-06/D-07), D-09 footer request CTA (depends on 15-02's /api/capabilities/request route)
- [x] 15-04-PLAN.md — admin capability-requests approval queue page + component (D-03/D-11)
